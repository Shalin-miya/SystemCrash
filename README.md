### Project Description
Power Pitch is a html, css, java powered website which uses AI tools to improve your language proficiency and boosting your confidence in public speaking.
It aims at building a strong base in using the language effeciently by rectifing errors and putting you through a grading sysytem.

### The Problem statement
How many of you have lacked confidence while facing an audience just because you aren't a master of the language?
Ofcourse we all have faced the same issue at some point or the other in our life and it's completely alright!
What matters is have you ever thought of changing it and improving yourself? 
But then felt drained-of at the thought of not knowing were to start or how to embark on this journey of self improvement "alone"!

### The Solution
Power Pitch is just the language companion that you have been looking for, to help you gain control over your speaking skills,
keeping you motivated throughout your journey, prompting you out of your comfort zone and thus, in the long run, helping you change yourself for the better!
